A summary of the three tabs is set out below:

- **Inputs into the production process**: This section examines what products (goods and services) need to be used in order to produce other products, and of these, what proportion are domestically produced or imported.

- **Effect of a final use change**: This tab shows the effect of a change in final use for a product on the economy. It allows the user to retrieve the estimated impact on variables such as Gross Value Added (GVA) or imports.
